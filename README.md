## Setup

> **Dynatrace employees:** This workspace is pre-configured for the standard
> Dynatrace demo environment (`guu84124.apps.dynatrace.com`). No changes are
> required to run demos against the production demo tenant. Clone the repo,
> reload VS Code, and authenticate via your Dynatrace SSO when prompted.

### Choose Your Frontend

This workspace works with:
- **GitHub Copilot** in VS Code (requires subscription)
- **Claude Code** via web or desktop (requires Claude Pro or Team)

Select your setup path below. Both receive the same skills, prompts, and MCP server access.

**GitHub Copilot Path** → Follow Steps 1–6 below. Copilot loads `.github/copilot-instructions.md` automatically.

**Claude Code Path** → Follow Steps 1–5, then open `CLAUDE.md` in your Claude Code session. Claude loads `.claude/skills/` symlinks automatically.

### 1. Clone the workspace

```bash
git clone https://github.com/virtualrussel/dynatrace-ai-workspace.git
cd dynatrace-ai-workspace
```

Then open the folder in VS Code via **File → Open Folder**.

### 2. Update skills to latest

```bash
npx skills add dynatrace/dynatrace-for-ai
npx skills add dynatrace-oss/dtctl
```

> Run this command any time Dynatrace releases new skills.

### 3. Configure your sprint environment (optional)

The workspace is pre-configured with two MCP servers — the shared demo tenant
(`guu84124`) and a personal sprint tenant. The sprint entry is specific to the
original author and **must be updated** if you want to use your own sprint environment.

Complete all four steps below to fully configure your sprint tenant. Skipping
any step will result in Copilot referencing a server that doesn't exist or
authenticating against the wrong environment.

#### Sprint Tenant Checklist

**Step A — Update `.vscode/mcp.json`**

Replace `<your-tenant-id>` with your personal sprint tenant ID (e.g. `abc12345`):

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "guu84124-mcp": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@dynatrace-oss/dynatrace-mcp-server@latest", "--stdio"],
      "env": {
        "DT_ENVIRONMENT": "https://guu84124.apps.dynatrace.com"
      }
    },
    "<your-tenant-id>-mcp": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@dynatrace-oss/dynatrace-mcp-server@latest", "--stdio"],
      "env": {
        "DT_ENVIRONMENT": "https://<your-tenant-id>.sprint.apps.dynatracelabs.com"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Step B — Update `.github/copilot-instructions.md` and `CLAUDE.md`**

Find the Environment table in both files and update the fallback server name and URL to match your tenant ID:

```
| **Fallback MCP server** | `<your-tenant-id>-mcp` → https://<your-tenant-id>.sprint.apps.dynatracelabs.com |
```

Both `.github/copilot-instructions.md` (GitHub Copilot) and `CLAUDE.md` (Claude Code) must be updated with your tenant ID or they will reference the original author's sprint environment.

**Step C — Authenticate dtctl**

```bash
dtctl auth login --context <your-tenant-id> \
  --environment "https://<your-tenant-id>.sprint.apps.dynatracelabs.com"
```

**Step D — Reload VS Code**

Press `Cmd+Shift+P` → `Developer: Reload Window` to register the new MCP server.

> If you only need the shared demo tenant (`guu84124`), skip this section entirely —
> no sprint configuration is required for demos.

### 4. Configure dtctl for the shared demo tenant (optional)

`dtctl` is used for terminal-level verification and resource management. It is
required for the `/daily-standup-notebook` prompt but optional for all other prompts.

```bash
# macOS — direct install (no Homebrew required)
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dynatrace-oss/dtctl/main/install.sh | bash

# Authenticate against the shared demo tenant
dtctl auth login --context guu84124 \
  --environment "https://guu84124.apps.dynatrace.com"

# Verify
dtctl doctor
```

### 5. Reload VS Code

Press `Cmd+Shift+P` → `Developer: Reload Window`

When you first use a prompt in Copilot Chat, a browser window will open for
Dynatrace SSO authentication. This is expected — complete the login and return
to VS Code. Subsequent sessions authenticate automatically.

### 6. Verify the connection

**GitHub Copilot users:** In Copilot Chat, type:

```
Using the guu84124-mcp server, list the top 5 services by request volume in the last hour
```

**Claude Code users:** In Claude Code, type the same query or copy it from the GitHub Copilot instruction above.

If you see a table of services with request counts — you are live and ready to demo.

## Skills

Skills are domain knowledge files that teach Copilot how Dynatrace works — correct DQL syntax, field names, query patterns, and investigation workflows. They load automatically when relevant.

| Skill | What It Covers |
|---|---|
| `dt-dql-essentials` | DQL syntax, common pitfalls, query patterns — **load before any DQL** |
| `dt-obs-problems` | Davis Problems, root cause analysis, impact assessment |
| `dt-obs-logs` | Log queries, filtering, pattern analysis, error classification |
| `dt-obs-tracing` | Distributed traces, spans, failure detection, log correlation |
| `dt-obs-services` | RED metrics, SLA tracking, runtime-specific monitoring (Java, .NET, Node.js, Python, PHP, Go) |
| `dt-obs-hosts` | Host and process metrics, CPU, memory, disk, containers |
| `dt-obs-kubernetes` | Pods, workloads, nodes, labels, ingress, PVCs |
| `dt-obs-aws` | EC2, RDS, Lambda, ECS/EKS, VPC, cost optimization |
| `dt-obs-frontends` | RUM, Web Vitals, user sessions, mobile crashes |
| `dt-app-dashboards` | Dashboard JSON creation and modification |
| `dt-app-notebooks` | Notebook creation and analytics workflows |
| `dt-migration` | Classic entity DQL → Smartscape migration |
| `dtctl` | CLI commands for managing Dynatrace resources from the terminal |

## Prompts

Prompts are pre-built investigation workflows available as slash commands.

- **GitHub Copilot:** Type `/` in Copilot Chat (see `.github/prompts/`)
- **Claude Code:** Type `/` in Claude chat or paste prompt content from `.github/prompts/`

| Prompt | When to Use |
|---|---|
| `/health-check` | Routine service health — performance, problems, deployments, vulnerabilities |
| `/daily-standup` | Morning team report across multiple services with today vs yesterday comparison |
| `/daily-standup-notebook` | Standup report + Dynatrace notebook creation + dtctl verification |
| `/investigate-error` | "Something is wrong with this service" — error-focused investigation |
| `/troubleshoot-problem` | Deep 7-step investigation into a specific Dynatrace problem |
| `/incident-response` | Full production incident triage — all active problems, prioritized by business impact |
| `/performance-regression` | Did my deployment cause a slowdown? Before vs after comparison with trace analysis |

### Investigation Workflow

The prompts follow a structured drill-down pattern:

```
/health-check          →  flag concerns
/troubleshoot-problem  →  investigate a specific problem
/investigate-error     →  drill into error patterns
/incident-response     →  full triage when things are on fire
```

## Key Concepts

### Why Skills Matter

Copilot without skills will guess DQL syntax — and get it wrong. For example, it might use `event.status == "OPEN"` (doesn't exist) instead of `event.status == "ACTIVE"`, or `log.level` instead of `loglevel`. The skills encode the corrections for known failure modes before Copilot writes a single query.

### How MCP Works

The Dynatrace MCP server gives Copilot live API access to your environment. When you run `/health-check`, Copilot calls the MCP server to execute real DQL queries and return live data — not cached or synthetic results.

### The Investigation Rule

**Always start with problems, never with broad log searches.** Broad log queries without a problem context will hit Dynatrace's 500GB scan limit and return zero results. The prompts enforce this automatically.

## dtctl CLI

[dtctl](https://github.com/dynatrace-oss/dtctl) is a kubectl-style CLI for Dynatrace that complements this workspace — giving you terminal-level access to run DQL queries, manage workflows, verify notebooks, and more.

```bash
# macOS / Linux (direct install)
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dynatrace-oss/dtctl/main/install.sh | bash

# Authenticate against the shared demo tenant
dtctl auth login --context guu84124 \
  --environment "https://guu84124.apps.dynatrace.com"

# Verify
dtctl doctor

# Example commands
dtctl get workflows
dtctl get notebooks
dtctl query 'fetch dt.davis.problems | filter event.status == "ACTIVE" | limit 5'
```

---

## Keeping Up to Date

```bash
# Update all skills to latest
npx skills add dynatrace/dynatrace-for-ai
npx skills add dynatrace-oss/dtctl

# Commit the updates
git add .
git commit -m "Update skills to latest"
git push
```
