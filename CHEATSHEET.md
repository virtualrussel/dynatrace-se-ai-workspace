# Dynatrace AI Workspace — Cheat Sheet

**Use this to pick the right workflow, not write DQL.**

---

## When to use which workflow

| Situation | Start here | What you get back |
|-----------|------------|-------------------|
| Something is broken right now | `/incident-response` | All active problems prioritized by business impact, with mitigation steps and a shareable incident report |
| You have a specific problem ID | `/troubleshoot-problem` | 7-step RCA: scoped logs → error classification → trace timeline → root cause hypothesis |
| Error rates spiked after a deploy | `/performance-regression` | Before/after metrics comparison, bottleneck span, and a rollback or hotfix recommendation |
| Investigating error noise from a service | `/investigate-error [service-name]` | Top 3 error patterns with example logs, related traces, and remediation suggestions |
| Routine service health check | `/health-check [service-name]` | RED metrics, active problems, recent deployments, top slow endpoints, vulnerabilities |
| Morning catch-up across all services | `/daily-standup` | Per-service health status, today vs yesterday comparison, and action items |
| Standup + notebook for sharing | `/daily-standup-notebook` | Same as `/daily-standup` plus a Dynatrace notebook created and verified via dtctl |

---

## Workflow chaining

Most investigations follow this escalation path:

```
/daily-standup           → spot anomalies
  → /health-check        → confirm which service
    → /investigate-error → find the root cause
      → /troubleshoot-problem → deep-dive a specific problem
```

For live incidents, skip straight to `/incident-response` — it triages all active problems at once.

For deploys that went wrong, use `/performance-regression` — it compares before/after and recommends rollback or hotfix.

## Skills — what they unlock

Skills are loaded automatically when relevant. You can also ask for one directly.

| Ask about... | Skill used |
|---|---|
| Service error rates, latency, throughput | `dt-obs-services` |
| Kubernetes pods, workloads, crash loops | `dt-obs-kubernetes` |
| Host CPU, memory, disk, processes | `dt-obs-hosts` |
| Frontend performance, Web Vitals, RUM | `dt-obs-frontends` |
| Distributed traces, request flows | `dt-obs-tracing` |
| Log search and pattern analysis | `dt-obs-logs` |
| Problem RCA and impact scope | `dt-obs-problems` |
| AWS resources and infrastructure | `dt-obs-aws` |
| Dashboards — create or modify | `dt-app-dashboards` |
| Notebooks — create or modify | `dt-app-notebooks` |
| Terminal / CLI operations | `dtctl` |
| Writing any DQL query | `dt-dql-essentials` (always load first) |

---

## dtctl — terminal companion

`dtctl` is the CLI-side of this workspace. Use it when you want to verify, query, or manage resources from the terminal rather than through chat.

| Task | Command |
|------|---------|
| Verify connection | `dtctl doctor` |
| Run a DQL query | `dtctl query 'fetch dt.davis.problems \| filter event.status == "ACTIVE"'` |
| List workflows | `dtctl get workflows` |
| List notebooks | `dtctl get notebooks` |
| Switch environments | `dtctl config use-context production` / `dtctl config use-context sprint` |

The AI workflows and dtctl point at the same environment — use chat for investigation, dtctl for spot-checks and verification.

---

## When workflows stop short

These are expected behaviours, not errors:

| What you see | Why | What to do |
|---|---|---|
| "No active problems found" | No problems in last 7 days | Widen to recently closed problems, or check you're on the right environment |
| "No regression threshold exceeded" | `/performance-regression` found no signal | Trust the result — or re-run with a narrower timeframe if you suspect a specific window |
| "Could not correlate to a local file" | `/performance-regression` found the bottleneck span but no matching code | The slow code may be in a dependency or a service not in this workspace |
| Query returns 0 results | Filters too tight, or wrong entity | Verify the service name with `/health-check` first |
| 500GB scan limit hit | Log query too broad | A workflow should have scoped it — if writing your own query, add entity filter + tighter timeframe |

---

## Key rules

**Start with problems — never open-ended log searches.**
All workflows enforce this. If you skip it, you'll hit the 500GB scan limit.

**Scope everything to a problem timeframe.**
Workflows extract the timeframe automatically. If you're writing your own query, use ±5 min around the incident window.

**Let the workflow drive DQL — don't write queries from scratch.**
Ask: *"What were the error patterns during the last problem on [service]?"* — not *"Write a DQL query for..."*

---

## Session targeting

Default environment: `production-mcp` → https://guu84124.apps.dynatrace.com

To switch for the session:
```
"Use the sprint-mcp server for all queries in this session"
```

---

## Useful natural language prompts

These work well when you're not sure which workflow to reach for:

- *"Are there any active problems right now?"*
- *"What happened to [service] in the last hour?"*
- *"Show me the slowest endpoints for [service] since the last deployment"*
- *"Create a notebook summarising today's incidents"*
- *"What's the root cause of problem [ID]?"*
- *"Compare [service] performance before and after [deploy time]"*
