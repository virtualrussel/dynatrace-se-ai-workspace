description: Generate a daily standup report for JourneyService and CheckDestination, create an actionable Dynatrace notebook with embedded DQL queries and remediation steps, then verify it using dtctl.
---
Run a daily standup report for JourneyService and CheckDestination using the guu84124-mcp server.

Then create a Dynatrace notebook called "Daily Standup — JourneyService & CheckDestination — [TODAY'S DATE]".

Structure the notebook as follows:
1. Executive Summary — overall health status for both services
2. JourneyService Findings — metrics comparison, incidents, action items
3. CheckDestination Findings — metrics comparison, health confirmation
4. Embedded DQL Queries — include live queries for:
   - JourneyService avg and P95 response time trend (last 24h)
   - JourneyService error rate over time
   - Active problems related to JourneyService infrastructure
   - CheckDestination response time and error rate
5. Remediation Steps — specific next steps per service with priority

## DQL Query Rules
Before generating ANY DQL query, load the dt-dql-essentials skill and refer to the timeseries command specification. All queries must follow these rules exactly:

### Comments
- NEVER use # inside DQL queries — not valid DQL syntax
- NEVER use -- inside DQL queries
- Section titles and descriptions belong in notebook markdown sections ONLY, never inside query blocks

### timeseries Command
- NEVER use `as` for aliasing — use = assignment instead
  - WRONG: timeseries avg(dt.service.request.response_time) as avg_rt
  - CORRECT: timeseries avg_rt = avg(dt.service.request.response_time)
- NEVER use contains() in a timeseries filter — timeseries requires exact dimension matching via by: and ==
  - WRONG: | filter dt.service.name contains "CheckDestination"
  - CORRECT: timeseries ..., by: {dt.service.name} | filter dt.service.name == "CheckDestination"
- ALWAYS include by: {dt.service.name} when filtering timeseries by service
- ALWAYS use array notation for computed fields on timeseries results
  - CORRECT: | fieldsAdd avg_rt_ms = avg_rt[] / 1000

### General DQL
- ALWAYS use double quotes for string values, never single quotes
- ALWAYS specify time ranges explicitly: from: now()-24h, to: now()
- NEVER use filter field in ["a", "b"] — use filter in(field, "a", "b")
- NEVER use by: field1, field2 — use by: {field1, field2}

### Correct timeseries Template
Use this exact pattern for all service metric queries:

timeseries avg_rt = avg(dt.service.request.response_time),
  errors = sum(dt.service.request.failure_count),
  total = sum(dt.service.request.count),
  from: now()-24h, to: now(), interval: 1h,
  by: {dt.service.name}
| filter dt.service.name == "<exact-service-name>"
| fieldsAdd avg_rt_ms = avg_rt[] / 1000,
  error_rate = (errors[] * 100.0) / total[]

### Active Problems Template
Use this exact pattern for problem queries:

fetch dt.davis.problems, from: now()-24h
| filter not(dt.davis.is_duplicate) and event.status == "ACTIVE"
| filter matchesPhrase(event.name, "<service-name>")
| fields display_id, event.name, event.category, event.start
| sort event.start desc
| limit 10

## After Creating the Notebook
1. Confirm the notebook URL from the MCP response
2. Run dtctl get notebooks in the terminal to verify it appears in Dynatrace
3. Run dtctl describe notebook "[notebook name]" to confirm the structure
4. Share the verified URL for the team to access
